#Ozone levels increase from May (23.6 ppb) to a peak in August (60.0 ppb) before dropping in September (31.4 ppb), likely due to seasonal temperature changes and atmospheric conditions. Solar radiation is highest in July (216 W/mÂ²) and decreases in later months, influencing ozone formation. The data suggests that higher temperatures and sunlight contribute to increased ozone levels, while cooler conditions in September lead to a decline.
